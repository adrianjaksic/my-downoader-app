-If files are downloading and sync opperation ocure files will continue to download (if needed this can be easly changed, so when sync occure all downloads cancels).
-Number of paralel tasks can be set in App.config
-When I started with the task I missunderstood and made separate download for each file, to keep that functionality I added a new btn sync with download
